# lotus_notes_user_cert
A script certifying expiring users in Lotus Notes 7 where the equivalent user in active directory is enabled. 

My old employer had a very outdated instance of Lotus Notes running where a substantial amount of time was spent on manual administration.
A list of users whos certificates were due to expire, was sent to a consultant who manually recertified the them.
This happened every week and cost the company quite a lot every month.

The script is a total mess but it worked like a charm, and was in use for about 2 years.
Hopefully, no one will encounter a similar problem. But if so, perhaps a few lines can be of use.
